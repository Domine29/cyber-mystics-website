# Tarot Full-Stack Application

## 3rd Party APIs
  - Use some kind of tarot API (hard to find), maybe an astronomy one, and something else

## CRUD Design
  - A User will be able to READ from an API or database a spread of tarot cards (maybe pick a few or randomly generated) to render on their user page. This also CREATEs a database entry under the Model "Reading".
  - A user can then CRUD in their Reading database entry with a "Notes" field

## Models and Database Design
  -	For now, there will be one Model that I will create that will interact with the built-in User Model. There will be a Reading Model. In this case a User will have many Readings they can access, update, and delete (One-to-Many relationship). This will all be in a database using PSQL. 

## Styling, Presentation, and Site Navigation
  -	It will not be as ugly as other sites because I will use CSS and bootstrap. 

# Dream Journaling App

## Overall Description [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/vYqJcKUL/journaling-application)
  - User will create a new Dream Entry
  - They will be guided and prompted first to create a Dramatis Personae...
    - Dream Images: persons, objects, situations, colors, sounds, speech
    - Associations: any word, idea, mental picture, feeling, memory, anything that you spontaneously connect with the image. Choosing the right association...
      - An association will generate a lot of energy in you
      - It will fit with other symbols
      - Makes you see something in yourself that you never had before
      - use myths if they elicit energy within
  - After saving Dramatis Personae, user than its prompted to connect the Dream Image to an Inner Dynamic
    - Anything that goes inside you any energy taht lives and acts from within you. Inner conflict, inner personality acting trhough you, feeling, attitude, mood
    - connect image to characteristic
    - Inner personalities
    - Places: symbolic "houses" are different psychological environments, a different field of energy. 
    - Animals
  - Interpretations: tie everything together
    - what is the central, most importnat message taht this dream is trying to communciate to me? What is it advising me to do? 
    - Arguing opposites: play devil's advocate
    - Four Princciples for validating:
      - Shows you something you did not know
      - Avoid interpretations taht inflate th ego or is self-congratulatory
      - if dream comments on external situation, it will focus on the contribution of your attitudes and unconscious behavior patterns
      - Learn to live with dreams over time
  - Act consciously to honor your dreams: a simple, non-grandiouse physical act may suffice.
