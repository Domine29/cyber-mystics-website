# Tarot Full-Stack Application

## 3rd Party APIs
- Use some kind of tarot API (hard to find), maybe an astronomy one, and something else

## CRUD Design
- This will be implementing mostly with users with login and other User Authentication features. 
- A user will be able to READ from an API or database a spread of tarot cards (maybe pick a few or randomly generated) to render on their user page. This also CREATEs a database entry under the Model Reading
- A user can then CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE in their Reading database entry with a Notes field

## Models and Database Design
-	For now, there will be one Model that I will create that will interact with the built-in User Model. There will be a Reading Model. In this case a User will have many Readings they can access, update, and delete (One-to-Many relationship). This will all be in a database using PSQL. 
-	
## Styling, Presentation, and Site Navigation
-	It will not be as ugly as other sites because I will use CSS and bootstrap.
